This repository addresses the critical concern of safety in transportation, particularly focusing on the vulnerability of road users such as cyclists, pedestrians, and motorcyclists. The aim is to highlight the underreporting of injuries, especially those involving cyclists, in official road crash statistics. The significance of considering all road users in policy decisions is emphasized throughout. Below is a plot showing the latent topics within the crash narratives recieved from the [Ohio Department of Transportation](https://www.transportation.ohio.gov/)
